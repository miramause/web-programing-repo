            A toy  is an object that is used primarily to 
            provide entertainment. Simple examples include 
            toy blocks, board games, and dolls.
            Toys can provide utilitarian benefits, including physical exercise, 
            cultural awareness, or academic education.
            Playing with toys is an important part of aging.
